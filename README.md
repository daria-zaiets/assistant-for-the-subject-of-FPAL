 This site is my undergraduate college job. The goal of the project is to make a template for an electronic reference book for academic subjects. See below in more detail.

## :electric_plug:  **How to use** :bulb:
### ***Homepage***
The homepage contains links to all sections of the reference book. Each link is a block with an image and a title. You need to select a topic and click.

There are some more useful links at the top of the page.

Links are implemented with flebox, so adding new elements is easy.

### ***Typical page***
Typical page has 2 parts. First part is a tutorial text, that explains the selected topic.

Second part is a filter. Use it to navigate topics without going to home.

All other pages will be made in the same way as a typical.
